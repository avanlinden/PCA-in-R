# PCA-in-R
Principal components analysis in R

Want some PCA? You've got PCA! As a functional morphologist I've done enough principal components analyses to have a stockpile of code and a lot of lessons learned the hard way. I conceived of this tutorial for my friend Madi, who works with data on people's emotions. If "emotionspace" becomes a thing in psychology the way "morphospace" is a thing in biology, you heard it here first!
